# Using the code below as a starting point, write a while loop that prints the elements of lst at each index 
# and terminates after printing the last element of the list.

lst = [1, 3, 7, 15]
index = 0

while index < len(lst):
    print(lst[index])
    index += 1


# I assume this code outputs nothing because there are no indexes in the list to work with, but 
# it would be nice if Launch answered this question so I actually knew for sure

listy = []
index = 0

while index < len(listy):
    print(lst[index])
    index += 1
